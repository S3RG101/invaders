Models module for Alien Invaders

This module contains the model classes for the Alien Invaders game. Anything
that you interact with on the screen is model: the ship, the laser bolts, and
the aliens.

Just because something is a model does not mean there has to be a special
class for it. Unless you need something special for your extra gameplay
features, Ship and Aliens could just be an instance of GImage that you move
across the screen. You only need a new class when you add extra features to
an object. So technically Bolt, which has a velocity, is really the only model
that needs to have its own class.

With that said, we have included the subclasses for Ship and Aliens. That is
because there are a lot of constants in consts.py for initializing the
objects, and you might want to add a custom initializer.  With that said,
feel free to keep the pass underneath the class definitions if you do not want
to do that.

You are free to add even more models to this module.  You may wish to do this
when you add new features to your game, such as power-ups.  If you are unsure
about whether to make a new class or not, please ask on Piazza.

class Ship(GImage):
    """
    A class to represent the game ship.

    At the very least, you want a __init__ method to initialize the ships
    dimensions. These dimensions are all specified in consts.py.

    You should probably add a method for moving the ship.  While moving a
    ship just means changing the x attribute (which you can do directly),
    you want to prevent the player from moving the ship offscreen.  This
    is an ideal thing to do in a method.

    You also MIGHT want to add code to detect a collision with a bolt. We
    do not require this.  You could put this method in Wave if you wanted to.
    But the advantage of putting it here is that Ships and Aliens collide
    with different bolts.  Ships collide with Alien bolts, not Ship bolts.
    And Aliens collide with Ship bolts, not Alien bolts. An easy way to
    keep this straight is for this class to have its own collision method.

    However, there is no need for any more attributes other than those
    inherited by GImage. You would only add attributes if you needed them
    for extra gameplay features (like animation).

    the bolt.

    The class Wave will need to look at these attributes, so you will need
    getters for them.  However, it is possible to write this assignment with
    no setters for the velocities.  That is because the velocity is fixed and
    cannot change once the bolt is fired.

    In addition to the getters, you need to write the __init__ method to set
    the starting velocity. This __init__ method will need to call the __init__
    from GRectangle as a  helper.

    You also MIGHT want to create a method to move the bolt.  You move the
    bolt by adding the velocity to the y-position.  However, the getter
    allows Wave to do this on its own, so this method is not required.
